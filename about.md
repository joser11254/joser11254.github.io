# About Me
Hello! I am [JR].
I really like playing soccer, and I also like playing on my phone. I am really good in math, videogames, and playing soccer. My goal is to get really good grades this year.

My current top choice is a pilot. My current top choice is a pilot because I really like all sorts of stuff that involves flying in a plane so I think that a pilot would be a really good job for me. My lifestyle goals are to travel a lot around the world and if I am a pilot I think I can make that goal work. This course will help me be a better pilot because it helps me improve my thinking skills, and also helps me improve my leadership skills which I think are one of the most important skills that a pilot can have
